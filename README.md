# PINN-Shock-Relaxation-Shallow-Water
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for hydrodynamic and shallow water flow problems, including shock-dominated regimes. The repository contains the research implementation used in the associated study, featuring locally relaxed momentum constraints, adaptive weighting, and sequential training for discontinuous flows.
